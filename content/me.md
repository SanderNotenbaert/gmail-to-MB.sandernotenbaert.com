Hi, I'm Sander. I do a lot of different thing and where a lot of different "hats".
primarily I'm a musician, music producer, educator,... In that process I have gotten deeper into
the programming side of things, developing tools for live performance and production. You can
find some of the things I have made publically available [here](https://gumroad.com/fluxwork).

As a musician I've also had to deal with the slop of having to do my own accounting. Every now and then
I've been using my increasing programming experience to automate some those things to make my life easier.
I'm really the forgetful type, if it's not right there under my nose, my admin becomes a mess very quickly.
That's where this add-on comes in, and I might have another tool or two in the pipeline. I hope others
find it as helpful for their productivity as I have for mine.

Curious about my music or other work?
