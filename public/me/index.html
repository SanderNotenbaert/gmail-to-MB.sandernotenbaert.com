  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p><img src="/its-a-me.jpg" alt="its-a-me"></p>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Sander. I do a lot of different thing and where a lot of different &ldquo;hats&rdquo;.
primarily I&rsquo;m a musician, music producer, educator,&hellip; In that process I have gotten deeper into
the programming side of things, developing tools for live performance and production. You can
find some of the things I have made publically available <a href="https://gumroad.com/fluxwork" target="_blank" >here</a>

.</p>
<p>As a musician I&rsquo;ve also had to deal with the slop of having to do my own accounting. Every now and then
I&rsquo;ve been using my increasing programming experience to automate some those things to make my life easier.
I&rsquo;m really the forgetful type, if it&rsquo;s not right there under my nose, my admin becomes a mess very quickly.
That&rsquo;s where this add-on comes in, and I might have another tool or two in the pipeline. I hope others
find it as helpful for their productivity as I have for mine.</p>
<p>Curious about my music or other work?
